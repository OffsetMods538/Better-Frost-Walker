# Better Frost Walker

As of version `1.1.3`, the mod now needs MonkeyLib538 to function. Please download it from here. (TODO: add link when released).  
MonkeyLib538 isn't yet released on modrinth, please download it from [here](https://github.com/OffsetMods538/MonkeyLib538/releases).

## What is this?
Ever wanted sprint-jump on water?  
What about walking on powdered snow with your *super max pro god netherite boots 14*?  
Still not impressed? How about walking on (waterlogged) kelp or seagrass?  
Well with **Better Frost Walker** you can do just that!

## But how?
All you have to do is enchant your boots with **frost walker 2** by using a book or the enchanting table!

## What about my farm that uses frost walker armor stands to do whatever?
By default, the mod only activates with frost walker *2*, so you can use frost walker *1* for your farms!  
That can be changed in the config file.
