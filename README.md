# Better Frost Walker

## What is this?
Ever wanted sprint-jump on water?
<br />
What about dying by trying to jump into water, but forgetting to take off your frost walker boots so you die?
<br />
Still not impressed? How about walking on kelp or seagrass?
<br />
Well with **Better Frost Walker** you can do just that!

## But how?
All you have to do is enchant your boots with **frost walker 2** by using a book or the enchanting table!

## What about my farm that uses frost walker armor stands to do whatever?
The mod only activates with frost walker *2*, so you can use frost walker *1* for your farms!
